# VCMI 1.6.0 released

A new major release just arrived: VCMI 1.6.0! This time we focused on AI, visuals and numerous GUI and UX additions for even more immersive experience.

<!-- more -->

## Better visuals
VCMI now can improve graphics quality thanks to smart xBRZ upscaling, plus support for high-resolution assets – perfect for high-resolution displays (and smartphones too). 

## Smarter AI
Our adventure map AI (Nullkiller AI) was greatly enhanced, and some combat AI tweaks also landed. 

## Heroes Chronicles support
If you own Heroes Chronicles on GOG, you can now import these campaigns seamlessly via the “import files” option in our Launcher.

## Statistics and handicap
New handicap feature can not only handle gold transfer known from PvP games, but also change growth and income to adjust game challenge over wide range.
And once a scenario is finished, a new screen shows detailed statistics like resource flow and army power over time.

## Spell research and quick spell panel
We’ve added a simplified version of long-requested spell research, which you can enable through HotA mod. In combat, a new spell quick-selection panel (with optional hotkeys) makes casting your favorite spells faster than ever.

## Handy shortcuts
Holding **Alt** on the adventure map now highlights interactive objects. You can also re-roll spells in your town’s guild (via HotA mod), sort artifacts artifacts and more.

## Full changelog
There are hundreds of other improvements under the hood, from new modding features to campaign refinements and stability fixes.
